    About
</h1>
<p>
    I am currently a Software Consultant & Developer at Atomic Object in Ann Arbor, MI. I graduated from U.C. Berkeley
    in 2012 with a dual degree in Mathematics and EECS and started my career as a software engineer at Sunrun. In 2017,
    I left the San Francisco bay area for Ann Arbor and have been enjoying the weather ever since /s.
</p>
<p>
    I hold a special place in my heart for Java, but am a firm proponent of choosing the right tool for the job. So far
    in my career, I have worked on server-side REST APIs, client-side SPAs, and native mobile apps.
</p>
<p>
    Outside of work, I enjoy watching video games (eSports?) such as Starcraft II (there are whole dozens of us!) and
    Overwatch to name a few. I also dance International Standard ballroom.
