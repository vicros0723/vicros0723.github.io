        <h1>Science that isn't science</h1>
    </header>
    <p>
        I wanted to kick off this inaugural post with a topic I first read about years ago: cargo cult science. A quick
        Google search turns up <a href="http://www.lhup.edu/~DSIMANEK/cargocul.htm">Richard Feynman's 1974 CalTech
        commencement address</a> as the first usage of this term and if you have not read the adaptation, I highly
        recommend you do so now. Although Feynman was talking from the perspective of a researcher, his points are
        equally valid in the world of software engineering.
    </p>
    <p>
        As frameworks become ever more complex and rely upon ever more dependencies, programmers struggle to deeply
        understand the technology they use. Although this may appear to be a terrible situation, I suggest that it is
        not; if anything, it is necessary for us to progress rather than reinvent the wheel. Problems occur when the
        framework behaves in an unexpected manner and the deeper lack of understanding prevents us from figuring out
        why.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most developers (myself included) have used the tried and true programming method: copy-paste-edit-pray-repeat.
        Especially prevalent among novice users without a mentor, this method is actually a fantastic way to learn. It
        is a perfect demonstration of the scientific method: question, hypothesize, predict, test, analyze. Well,
        it would be if we actually analyzed. Without the analysis, all we do is cargo cult programming.
    </p>
    <p>
        The last time you set up a Webpack config, did you actually understand what all the options did? Or did you
        copy-paste-edit-pray-repeat? What about standing up your CI infrastructure? When you blindly re-run tests after
        they fail mysteriously, you're participating in cargo cult programming.
    </p>
    <p>
        None of this is to say that software engineers need to understand the nuances of every transitive dependency in
        their project. However, copy-paste-edit-pray-repeat should always include analysis and a deeper understanding
        of the tools we use.
